# Python Basics

These exercises help you practice fundamental Python concepts like variables, strings, numbers, and simple functions.

## Tips

- Read through each TODO in the Python files.
- Try writing the code yourself before asking for help.
- Run `pytest` to check your work and read the failure messages carefully if a test fails.
- When you're done, summarize what you learned in `notes/sessions/`.
