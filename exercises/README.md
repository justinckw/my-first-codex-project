# Exercises

Practice Python topics by completing exercises organized into subfolders. Each folder contains:

- A short README describing the goal.
- One or more Python files with TODOs or starter code.
- Optional tests under `tests/` to verify your solution.

Mark exercises as complete by committing your solution and noting what you learned in the `notes/` folder.
