# Projects

This folder is for larger experiments that combine multiple concepts. Some ideas:

- Build a simple calculator or to-do app.
- Parse data from a CSV file and analyze it.
- Create a command-line game like hangman or tic-tac-toe.
- Explore APIs using the `requests` library.

Create a new folder for each project (e.g., `projects/calculator/`) and add a README describing what you built and what you learned.
