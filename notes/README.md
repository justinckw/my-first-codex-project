# Notes

Use this folder to capture what you learn. Some ideas:

- Summaries of new concepts.
- Snippets of code you want to remember.
- Links to helpful tutorials or videos.
- Reflections on what was confusing and how you solved it.

You can create subfolders for topics (e.g., `notes/functions.md`, `notes/oop/`), or keep everything in one file. Whatever helps future-you the most!
